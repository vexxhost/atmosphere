    The Ceph CSI driver now supports external Ceph clusters without
    requiring SSH access to the Ceph monitors. You can configure this by
    setting the ``ceph_csi_rbd_ceph_fsid``, ``ceph_csi_rbd_monitors``, and
    ``ceph_csi_rbd_keyring`` variables. When you define these variables,
    the role skips the SSH-based discovery and user creation tasks.

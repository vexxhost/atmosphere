    The ``AlertmanagerClusterCrashlooping`` alert no longer fires false
    positives. The ServiceMonitor relabeling configuration now preserves the
    ``endpoint`` label, preventing metrics from multiple endpoints on the same
    pod from merging into a single time series. This fix applies to all
    ServiceMonitors including Alertmanager, Prometheus, Grafana, and other
    monitoring components.

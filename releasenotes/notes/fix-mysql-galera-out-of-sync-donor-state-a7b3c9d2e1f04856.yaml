    The ``MySQLGaleraOutOfSync`` alert no longer fires false positives during
    Percona XtraDB Cluster (PXC) operator backups. The patched expression
    excludes Galera Donor state
    (``wsrep_local_state=2``), which is a normal transient state when a node
    serves as a donor for State Snapshot Transfer. The separate
    ``MySQLGaleraDonorFallingBehind`` alert still covers problematic donor
    scenarios.

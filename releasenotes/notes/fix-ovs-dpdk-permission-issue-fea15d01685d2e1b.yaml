    When use OVS with DPDK, by default both OVS and OVN run with root user,this
    may cause issue that QEMU can't write vhostuser socket file in openvswitch
    runtime dir(/run/openvswitch). This has been fixed by config Openvswitch
    and OVN componments to run with  non root user id 42424 which is same with
    QEMU and other OpenStack services inside the container.

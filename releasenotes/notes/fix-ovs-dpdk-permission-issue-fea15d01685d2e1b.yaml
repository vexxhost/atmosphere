    When use OVS with DPDK, by default both OVS and OVN run with root user, this
    may cause issue that QEMU can't write vhost user socket file in openvswitch
    runtime directory (``/run/openvswitch``). This has been fixed by config Open
    vSwitch and OVN components to run with non root user id 42424 which is same
    with QEMU and other OpenStack services inside the container.

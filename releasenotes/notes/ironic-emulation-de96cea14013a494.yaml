    Add Ironic emulator support for AIO develop environments (OVN only).
    Atmosphere environment could not fully exercise
    Ironic workflows without access to physical bare-metal hardware. This limitation
    reduced the ability to develop, test, and validate bare-metal provisioning
    features in local and CI environments. This change introduces support for an
    Ironic emulator in AIO deployments, allowing bare-metal provisioning workflows
    to run entirely in a virtualized environment. The update integrates a Redfish
    emulator (sushy) and includes the required networking and emulated node
    configuration for Ironic.
    A new configuration option, ``ATMOSPHERE_BAREMETAL_EMULATOR_ENABLED``, controls
    whether the emulator is enabled. This enhancement improves development velocity,
    test coverage, and CI reliability for Ironic without requiring physical hardware.

    Fix ``OctaviaAmphoraNotReady`` monitoring rule to recognize both ``READY`` and ``ALLOCATED``
    as valid Amphora statuses. Previously, the monitoring rule fired for Amphora instances in ``ALLOCATED``
    status, which is a normal operational state. The monitoring rule now uses the name
    ``OctaviaAmphoraNotOperational`` to better reflect its purpose of detecting
    non-operational Amphora instances.

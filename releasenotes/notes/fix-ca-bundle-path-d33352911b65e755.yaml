fixes:
  - Fixed containers failing to validate TLS certificates on
    Red Hat-based systems. The issue occurred when mounting the OpenSSL
    trusted certificate bundle (``/etc/pki/ca-trust/extracted/openssl/ca-bundle.trust.crt``)
    which uses the "TRUSTED CERTIFICATE" format that's incompatible with
    Go applications. The configuration now uses the standard PEM format
    bundle (``/etc/pki/ca-trust/extracted/pem/tls-ca-bundle.pem``) on
    Red Hat systems, which resolves certificate validation errors.

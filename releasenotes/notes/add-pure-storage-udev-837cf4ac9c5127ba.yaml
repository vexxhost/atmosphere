    Added udev rules for Pure Storage devices to optimize iSCSI LUN performance.
    The rules:
    - Set the I/O scheduler to `none` for improved throughput.
    - Reduce CPU usage by disabling entropy collection.
    - Balance CPU load by directing I/O completions to the originating CPU.
    - Increase the HBA timeout to 60 seconds for reliable I/O operations.

    Percona backup operations now use a default backup image, eliminating
    the need to specify an image for each individual backup job. This
    streamlines the backup configuration process and reduces configuration
    overhead for operators managing database backups.
    The default image is automatically applied to all backup jobs unless
    explicitly overridden, ensuring consistent backup tooling across the
    cluster while maintaining flexibility for advanced use cases.

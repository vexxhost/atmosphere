    Enabled the Neutron RPC server deployment (``deployment_rpc_server``) for OVN
    backends by removing the explicit ``false`` override in Helm values. This fixes
    OVN VPN agent crashes caused by RPC timeouts when the agent attempts to
    communicate with the Neutron server over the ``oslo.messaging`` transport.

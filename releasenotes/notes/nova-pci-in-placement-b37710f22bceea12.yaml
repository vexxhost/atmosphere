    Nova's PCI-in-placement feature is now enabled by default. This feature
    improves PCI device resource tracking and scheduling by integrating PCI
    devices with the placement service. The scheduler can now make more
    intelligent decisions about PCI device allocation using placement's
    allocation candidates API.

    The placement service user now has the 'service' role in addition to
    the 'admin' role. This is required for Nova compute services to properly
    report PCI device inventory to placement and make allocation requests.

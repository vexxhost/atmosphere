    Nova's Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI) in placement feature is now
    enabled by default. This feature improves device resource tracking and
    scheduling by integrating these devices with the placement service. The
    scheduler can now make more intelligent decisions about device
    allocation using placement's allocation candidates API.

    The placement service user now also has the 'service' role alongside
    the 'admin' role. Nova compute services need this role to
    report device inventory to placement and make allocation requests.

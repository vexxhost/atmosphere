    Nova's PCI (Peripheral Component Interconnect) in placement feature is now
    enabled by default. This feature improves PCI device resource tracking and
    scheduling by integrating PCI devices with the placement service. The
    scheduler can now make more intelligent decisions about PCI device
    allocation using placement's allocation candidates API.

    The placement service user now also has the 'service' role alongside
    the 'admin' role. Nova compute services need this role to
    report PCI device inventory to placement and make allocation requests.

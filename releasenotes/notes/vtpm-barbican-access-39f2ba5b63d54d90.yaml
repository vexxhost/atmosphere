    Add options to configure Barbican policy for vTPM support. When a compute
    node reboots, Nova needs to access Barbican secrets to start vTPM-enabled
    virtual machines automatically. Two new variables control this behavior:
    ``barbican_policy_nova_secret_access`` enables the Nova service account to
    read secrets, and ``barbican_policy_admin_secret_access`` enables admin
    users to access all secrets. Both default to false.

    When ``barbican_policy_nova_secret_access`` or
    ``barbican_policy_admin_secret_access`` is set to true, secret isolation
    between projects is reduced. The Nova service account or admin users
    can access any secret in Barbican, not just vTPM-related secrets.
    Enable these options only if you require automatic vTPM virtual machine
    restart after compute node reboots.

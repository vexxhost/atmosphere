features:
  - Introduced a new Rust-based binary ``ovsinit`` which focuses on handling
    the migration of IP addresses from a physical interface to an OVS bridge
    during the Neutron or OVN initialization process.
fixes:
  - During a Neutron or OVN initialization process, the routes assigned to
    the physical interface are now removed and added to the OVS bridge
    to maintain the connectivity of the host.

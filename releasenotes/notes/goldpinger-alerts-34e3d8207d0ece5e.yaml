features:

    Replaced the single ``GoldpingerNodesUnhealthy`` alert with four
    granular Goldpinger alerts that reduce noise and provide clearer
    signal: ``GoldpingerHighUnhealthyRatio``,
    ``GoldpingerNodeUnreachable``, ``GoldpingerHighPeerLatency``, and
    ``GoldpingerHighErrorRate``.
upgrade:
  - |
    This release removes the ``GoldpingerNodesUnhealthy`` alert and
    replaces it with four new alerts. Update any alert routing rules or
    silences that reference ``GoldpingerNodesUnhealthy`` to use the new
    alert names.

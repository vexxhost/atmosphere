    Fix ``openstacksdk`` installation failures on Ubuntu 24.04 caused by
    PEP 668 ("Externally Managed Environments"). Ubuntu now prevents ``pip``
    from modifying the system Python environment, which caused
    ``ansible.builtin.pip`` tasks to fail. The role installs ``openstacksdk``
    using ``ansible.builtin.package`` instead of the ``ansible.builtin.pip``
    module, ensuring compatibility with PEP 668–compliant systems.

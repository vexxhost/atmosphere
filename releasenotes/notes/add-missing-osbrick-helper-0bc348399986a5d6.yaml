fixes:
  - The ``[privsep_osbrick]/helper_command`` configuration value was not
    configured in both of the Cinder and Nova services, which lead to the
    inability to run certain CLI commands since it instead tried to do a plain
    ``sudo`` instead.  This has been fixed by adding the missing helper command
    configuration to both services.

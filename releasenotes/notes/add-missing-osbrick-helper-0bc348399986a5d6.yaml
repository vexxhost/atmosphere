fixes:
  - The ``[privsep_osbrick]/helper_command`` configuration value was not
    configured in both of the Cinder and Nova services, which lead to the
    inability to run certain CLI commands since it instead tried to do a plain
    ``sudo`` instead.  This has been fixed by adding the missing helper command
    configuration to both services.
  - The ``dmidecode`` package which is required by the ``os-brick`` library for
    certain operations was not installed on the images that needed it, which
    can cause NVMe-oF discovery issues.  The package has been added to all
    images that require it.

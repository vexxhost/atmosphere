fixes:
  - The ``[privsep_osbrick]/helper_command`` configuration value wasn't
    configured in both of the Cinder and Nova services, which lead to the
    inability to run certain CLI commands since it instead tried to do a plain
    ``sudo`` instead. This has been fixed by adding the missing helper command
    configuration to both services.
  - The ``dmidecode`` package which is required by the ``os-brick`` library for
    certain operations wasn't installed on the images that needed it, which
    can cause NVMe-oF discovery issues. The package has been added to all
    images that require it.
  - The ``[cinder]/auth_type`` configuration value wasn't set resulting in
    the entire Cinder section not being rendered in the configuration file, it
    is now set to ``password`` which will fully render the Cinder section
    for OpenStack Nova.

    The Open vSwitch container image now uses a more centralized location at
    `ghcr.io/vexxhost/docker-openvswitch`. This provides better
    maintainability and a dedicated repository for the Open vSwitch container
    images. The image now uses a specific version tag (v3.3.6-2) for
    better reproducibility and stability.

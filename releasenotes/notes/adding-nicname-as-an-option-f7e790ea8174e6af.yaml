    This script change helps alleviate the issue of heterogeneous server environments having a consistent pci_id.
    This change will enable usage of host interface names which can be set to a consistent value despite pci_id 
    differing when deploying the server. Defaults to using pci_id parameter if present for backwards compatibility.

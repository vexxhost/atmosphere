    In an Open Virtual Network (OVN) deployment where external (bare metal) ports connect to
    Virtual Local Area Network (VLAN) networks, the system must bind the internal router port
    associated with the network to the same HA chassis group of the network. This mimics
    the way the external port of the router functions in relation to the
    upstream gateway.

    In essence, the bare metal ports can't communicate with their
    default gateway if either the internal router port is unbound or if
    the virtual router doesn't have an external gateway set, with the external
    router port bound to the same exact chassis and with the same exact
    priorities as the HA chassis group of the VLAN network.

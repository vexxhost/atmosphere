    In an OVN deployment where external (baremetal) ports connect to VLAN
    networks, you need to bind the internal router port associated with
    the network to the same `ha_chassis_group` as the network. This setup
    mimics how the external port of the router functions in relation to
    the upstream gateway.

    In essence, the baremetal ports aren't able to communicate with their
    default gateway if either the internal router port is unbound or if
    the vrouter doesn't have an external gateway set, with the external
    router port bound to the same exact chassis and with the same exact
    priorities as the `ha_chassis_group` of the VLAN network.

fixes:
  - |
    Fixed OAuth2 Proxy configuration to allow API access with valid JWT tokens
    without requiring interactive login. The issue was caused by OAuth2 Proxy
    enforcing login for all requests by default. This fix allows ``Alertmanager``
    API and other services behind OAuth2 Proxy to be accessed programmatically
    using valid JWT tokens.

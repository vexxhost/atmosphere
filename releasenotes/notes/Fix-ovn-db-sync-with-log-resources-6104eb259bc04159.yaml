    Applied `patch 948053 <https://review.opendev.org/c/openstack/neutron/+/948053>`_
    to resolve database synchronization issues between Neutron and Open Virtual
    Network (OVN) for log resources. This patch addresses `bug 2107925
    <https://bugs.launchpad.net/neutron/+bug/2107925>`_ where the
    ``neutron_pg_drop`` table could be incorrectly deleted during
    synchronization when existing log resources are present. The fix also
    updates the Access Control List (ACL) table to maintain proper
    synchronization of log resources between the Neutron and OVN databases.

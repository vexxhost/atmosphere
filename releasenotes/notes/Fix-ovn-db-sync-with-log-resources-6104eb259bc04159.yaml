    Add `fix patch <https://review.opendev.org/c/openstack/neutron/+/948053>`_
    for neutron OVN (Open Virtual Network) db sync with log resources. This fix
    addresses the `issue <https://bugs.launchpad.net/neutron/+bug/2107925>_`
    that `neutron_pg_drop` might get delete when sync with existing log
    resources exists.
    Additionally, fix log resource in the ACL (Access Control List)
    table to correctly sync between the neutron and OVN (Open Virtual Network)
    databases.

    Upgrade the libvirt Helm chart from ``0.1.27`` to ``1.1.0`` to address critical
    issues with pod termination on systems using newer kernels. The updated chart
    includes proper mounting of the ``misc`` cgroup controller, which resolves
    failures where pods were unable to terminate correctly. This fix ensures
    stable pod lifecycle management in environments with modern kernel versions.

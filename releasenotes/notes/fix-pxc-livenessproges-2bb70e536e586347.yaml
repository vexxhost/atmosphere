fixes:
  - |
    Increased the liveness probe timeouts for the Percona XtraDB Cluster.
    The configuration now sets ``timeoutSeconds`` to ``60`` and ``failureThreshold`` to ``100``.
    This change helps the cluster remain responsive and prevents unnecessary restarts during prolonged operations.
  - |
    Changed the liveness check from the MySQL exporter sidecar to a readiness check.
    The sidecar should wait indefinitely for the main containers and shouldn't terminate database pods.
    Especially during long SST operations. This change improves the cluster's stability during extended operations.

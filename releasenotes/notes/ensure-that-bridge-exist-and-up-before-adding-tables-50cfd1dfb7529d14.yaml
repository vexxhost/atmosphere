    Ensure that the bridge exists and is up before adding tables

    At the moment OVN NB driver attempts to add routes for the device
    which is in DOWN state, which results in exception:
    ``pyroute2.netlink.exceptions.NetlinkError: (100, 'Network is down')``

    Such scenario is possible in case of migration from regular L2 OVN to
    BGP or corner cases where operators didn't manage to ensure device
    to be UP in their network configuration.

    Anyway, it's better to handle such cases and ensure required devices
    are in proper state before executing actions towards them.

issues:
  - |
    When a loadbalancer is stuck in for example provisioning_state PENDING_UPDATE 
    but operational_state is ONLINE. No alert is generated.
fixes:
  - |
    To Fix this issues we need to change our alert rule from 'openstack_loadbalancer_loadbalancer_status{provisioning_status!="ACTIVE"} > 0'
    into 'count by (id,name) (openstack_loadbalancer_loadbalancer_status{job="openstack-exporter",provisioning_status!="ACTIVE"}) > 0'
    since the values of metrics openstack_loadbalancer_loadbalancer_status was always 0 when the operational_state is ONLINE

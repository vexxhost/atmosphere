    Fix When a lb is stuck in for example provisioning_state PENDING_UPDATE
    but operational_state is ONLINE. No alert is generated because gauge from metrics
    `openstack_loadbalancer_loadbalancer_status{provisioning_status!="ACTIVE"}`
    depends on operational_state which will ignore the ONLINE state

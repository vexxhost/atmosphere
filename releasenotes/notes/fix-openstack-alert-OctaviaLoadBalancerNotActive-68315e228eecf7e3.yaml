    Improve alert generation for load balancers that have a non-``ACTIVE`` provisioning state
    despite an ``ONLINE`` operational state. Previously, if a load balancer was in a
    transitional state such as ``PENDING_UPDATE`` (``provisioning_state``) while still marked
    as ``ONLINE`` (``operational_state``), the gauge metric
    ``openstack_loadbalancer_loadbalancer_status{provisioning_status!="ACTIVE"}`` didn't
    trigger an alert. This update addresses the issue by ensuring that alerts are properly
    generated in these scenarios.

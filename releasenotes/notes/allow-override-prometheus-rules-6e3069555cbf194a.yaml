    Support override Prometheus rules with new jsonnet file.
    Introduce new variable `kube_prometheus_stack_rules_jsonnet_path`
    in kube_prometheus_stack to override Prometheus rules. You can
    override completely or mixin existing rules in new jsonnet file.
    Check ``admin/monitoring.rst`` document for how to include existing rules
    for mixin.
    `kube_prometheus_stack_rules_jsonnet_path` variable default to
    `jsonnet/rules.jsonnet`

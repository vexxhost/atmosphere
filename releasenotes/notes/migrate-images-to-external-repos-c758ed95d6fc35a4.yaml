    All container images now use external repositories at ``ghcr.io/vexxhost``
    instead of the Atmosphere repository. The images for OVN, Open vSwitch,
    libvirt, and all OpenStack services have dedicated repositories with
    independent versioning and release cycles. This change improves
    maintainability and removes all image build infrastructure from
    Atmosphere.

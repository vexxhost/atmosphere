    The Atmosphere project now includes the Tap-as-a-Service (TaaS) extension for the OpenStack
    Neutron networking service. This feature introduces local and remote port mirroring
    capabilities, enabling tenants and cloud administrators to monitor and debug complex virtual
    networks by capturing and analyzing network traffic associated with virtual machines.

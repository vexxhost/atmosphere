    The ``libvirt-tls-sidecar`` image now uses version v1.0.1 instead of
    v1.0.0. This update adds a missing package required for the certificate
    renewal hook. Without this package, the hook that signals QEMU processes
    to reread TLS certificates can't run, so VM consoles stop working when
    certificates expire and don't reload.

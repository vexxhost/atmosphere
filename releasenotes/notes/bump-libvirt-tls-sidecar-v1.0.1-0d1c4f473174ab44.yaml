    The ``libvirt-tls-sidecar`` image updated from v1.0.0 to v1.0.1, which
    adds a missing package required for the certificate renewal hook. Without
    this package, the hook that signals QEMU processes to reread their TLS
    certificates can't execute, causing VM consoles to stop working when
    certificates expire and aren't reloaded.

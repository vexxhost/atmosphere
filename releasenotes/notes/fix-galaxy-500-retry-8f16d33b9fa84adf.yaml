    Added retry logic to handle transient failures when Galaxy API returns 500
    errors during collection installation. The molecule test workflow now
    retries up to 3 times with a 30-second delay between attempts. Also added
    ``ansible.cfg`` to configure increased timeout (180 seconds) for Galaxy API
    requests to better handle slow or overloaded servers.

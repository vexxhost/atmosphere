features:
  - |
    Replaced the basic ``HighInternalServerErrors`` alert with two
    SLO-based NGINX Ingress alerts that provide better signal and reduce
    noise: ``NginxIngressHighErrorRate`` (fires when error rate exceeds
    5%) and ``NginxIngressCriticalErrorRate`` (fires when error rate
    exceeds 20%). These alerts follow the SRE alerting philosophy with
    proper severity levels, detailed annotations, and comprehensive
    runbook documentation.
upgrade:
  - |
    This release removes the ``HighInternalServerErrors`` alert and
    replaces it with ``NginxIngressHighErrorRate`` and
    ``NginxIngressCriticalErrorRate``. Update any alert routing rules or
    silences that reference ``HighInternalServerErrors`` to use the new
    alert names.

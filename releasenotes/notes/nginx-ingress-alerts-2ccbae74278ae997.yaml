    Replaced the basic ``HighInternalServerErrors`` alert with four
    multi-window burn-rate alerts following the Google Site Reliability
    Engineering (SRE) Workbook pattern, all based on a 99.9% availability
    SLO: ``NginxIngressCriticalErrorBudgetBurn`` (P2, 14.4x burn rate),
    ``NginxIngressHighErrorBudgetBurn`` (P2, 6x burn rate),
    ``NginxIngressModerateErrorBudgetBurn`` (P3, 3x burn rate), and
    ``NginxIngressLowErrorBudgetBurn`` (P4, 1x burn rate). Each alert
    uses dual time windows to confirm issues are both sustained and
    ongoing, and includes a minimum traffic guard to prevent false
    positives on low-traffic services.

    This release removes the ``HighInternalServerErrors`` alert and
    replaces it with ``NginxIngressCriticalErrorBudgetBurn``,
    ``NginxIngressHighErrorBudgetBurn``,
    ``NginxIngressModerateErrorBudgetBurn``, and
    ``NginxIngressLowErrorBudgetBurn``. Update any alert routing rules
    or silences that reference ``HighInternalServerErrors`` to use the
    new alert names.

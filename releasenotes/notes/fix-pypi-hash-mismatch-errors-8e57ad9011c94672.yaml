    Fixes intermittent PyPI hash mismatch errors during package installation
    that caused job failures. The implementation adds retry logic with
    ``--no-cache-dir`` to avoid corrupted pip cache and automatically
    retries up to 3 times with a 5-second delay between attempts. This
    addresses transient network issues and corrupted downloads from PyPI
    that could previously cause entire jobs to fail.

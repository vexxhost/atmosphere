    Add "NeutronOVNACLNotSync" alert to detect any Neutron OVN ACL being out of sync.
    This alert is essential, as in worst case, an out-of-sync ACL could lead to
    network packet leaks. The default severity for this alert is critical.
    Additionally, add a new cron job to run OVN Database sync command in log mode,
    which will assist in detecting logs related to the "NeutronOVNACLNotSync" alert in Loki.

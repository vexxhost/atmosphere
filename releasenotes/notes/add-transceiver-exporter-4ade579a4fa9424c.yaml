    Added support for deploying the transceiver exporter, a Prometheus
    exporter for network transceivers. The exporter runs as a DaemonSet
    on all servers and exposes optical power and transceiver health
    metrics. Set ``atmosphere_transceiver_exporter_enabled`` to ``true``
    to enable it.

    When using OpenStack CLI with Single Sign-On (SSO) credentials in an
    environment without a GUI browser, you can authenticate via the Keystone
    v3 OIDC Device Authorization method. In this scenario, the OpenStack CLI
    will prompt you with a URL. You can copy this URL and open it in a browser
    on your desktop to complete the authentication process. Once completed,
    the CLI will use the returned token for subsequent OpenStack operations.

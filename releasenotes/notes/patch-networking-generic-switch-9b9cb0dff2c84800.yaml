    Fixed type errors in ``networking-generic-switch`` when users pass numeric
    configuration values as strings. The driver now automatically converts port
    numbers and timeout values to their correct types (``int`` or ``float``), preventing
    ``ConnectHandler`` failures when establishing connections to network devices.

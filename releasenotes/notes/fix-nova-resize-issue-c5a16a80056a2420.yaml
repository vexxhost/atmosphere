fixes:
  - Addressed an issue where instances not booted from volume would fail to resize.
    This issue was caused by a missing trailing newline in the SSH key, which led
    to misinterpretation of the key material during the resize operation. Adding
    proper handling of SSH keys ensures that the resize process works as intended
    for all instances.

    This change fixes a regression where Cinder volume creation fails with error
    ``oslo_privsep.daemon.FailedToDropPrivileges``.
    Since update to cinder 24.0.0, cinder-ceph container needs access to more
    capabilities for operations such as boot from volume or create a volume from an image.

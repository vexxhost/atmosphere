    Support boot-from-volume (BFV) for DHSS mode service instances in Manila
    shares. With boot-from-volume (BFV), share services gain greater
    resilience and recoverability.
    Administrators can create boot volumes either from an image or from
    base volume, depending on configuration. By default, the system enables
    this feature, but administrators can disable it through configuration.

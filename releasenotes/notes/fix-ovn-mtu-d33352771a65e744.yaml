issues:
  - The MTU for the metadata interfaces for OVN wasn't being set correctly,
    leading to a mismatch between the MTU of the metadata interface and the
    MTU of the network. This has been fixed with a Neutron change to ensure
    the ``neutron:mtu`` value in ``external_ids`` is set correctly.

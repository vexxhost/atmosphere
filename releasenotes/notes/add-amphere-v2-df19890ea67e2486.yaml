    Octavia Amphora V2 is now supported and enable by default with Atmosphere.
    The Amphora V2 provider driver improves control plane resiliency.
    Should a control plane host go down during a load balancer provisioning
    operation, an alternate controller can resume the in-process provisioning
    and complete the request. This solves the issue with resources stuck in
    PENDING_* states by writing info about task states in persistent data
    structure and monitoring job claims via Jobboard.

Atmosphere
##########

Atmosphere is an advanced OpenStack distribution that is powered by open source
technologies & built by `VEXXHOST <https://vexxhost.com>`_ powered by Kuberentes,
which allows you to easily deliver virtual machines, Kubernetes and bare-metal
on your on-premise hardware.

The difference between Atmosphere and other deployment tools is that it is
fully open source with batteries included.  It ships with settings that are
curated by years of experience from our team alongside other features such as:

- Built on top of Kubernetes for the life-cycle of the OpenStack cloud.
- Native integration with Keycloak for robust identity management.
- Native integration with `Cluster API driver for Magnum <https://github.com/vexxhost/magnum-cluster-api>`_
- Simplified deployment and management of the cloud using Kubernetes.
- Pre-integrated with many popular OpenStack projects with no additional configuration.
- Native integration with many storage platforms out of the box.
- Full day 2 operations for monitoring, logging and alerting out of the box using Prometheus, AlertManager, Grafana, Loki and more.

Cinder Configuration
####################

Cinder, the block storage service for OpenStack, can be configured to use a
variety of storage backends. This section guides you through setting up Cinder
with different backend technologies, each of which might require specific
configuration steps.

Cinder can be configured with multiple backends which would all be configured
inside of ``cinder_helm_values.conf.backends``.   The documentation below explains
how to configure a specific backend, but you can add multiple backends by
adding additional entries to the ``cinder_helm_values.conf.backends`` dictionary.

********
Ceph RBD
********

When using the integrated Ceph cluster provided with Atmosphere, no additional
configuration is needed for Cinder. The deployment process automatically
configures Cinder to use Ceph as the backend, simplifying setup and integration.

***************
Dell PowerStore
***************

In order to be able to use Dell PowerStore, you'll need to make sure that you
setup the hosts inside of your storage array. You'll also need to make sure
that they are not inside a host group or otherwise individual attachments will
not work.

You can enable the native PowerStore driver for Cinder with the following
configuration inside your Ansible inventory:

.. code-block:: yaml

    cinder_helm_values:
      storage: powerstore
      dependencies:
        static:
          api:

    nova_helm_values:
      conf:
        enable_iscsi: true

.. admonition:: About ``conf.enable_iscsi``
    :class: info

    The ``enable_iscsi`` setting is required to allow the Nova instances to
    expose volumes by making the `/dev` devices available to the containers,
    not necessarily to use iSCSI as the storage protocol. In this case, the
    PowerStore driver will use the storage protocol specified inside Cinder,

************
Pure Storage
************

Pure maintains a native Cinder driver that can be used to integrate with the
Pure Storage FlashArray. To enable the Pure Storage driver for Cinder, you need
to provide the necessary configuration settings in your Ansible inventory.

In order to use Pure Storage, you'll need to have the following information
available:

Volume Driver (``volume_driver``)
  Use ``cinder.volume.drivers.pure.PureISCSIDriver`` for iSCSI,
  ``cinder.volume.drivers.pure.PureFCDriver`` for Fibre Channel or
  ``cinder.volume.drivers.pure.PureNVMEDriver`` for NVME connectivity.

  If using the NVME driver, specify the ``pure_nvme_transport`` value, which the
  supported values are ``roce`` or ``tcp``.

Pure API Endpoint (``san_ip``)
  The IP address of the Pure Storage array’s management interface or a domain name
  that resolves to that IP address.

Pure API Token (``pure_api_token``)
  A token generated by the Pure Storage array that allows the Cinder driver to
  authenticate with the array.

You can use any other configuration settings that are specific to your needs
by referencing the `Cinder Pure Storage documentation <https://docs.openstack.org/cinder/latest/configuration/block-storage/drivers/pure-storage-driver.html>`_.

    Cinder instances will use the volume driver specified in ``volume_driver``.

********
StorPool
********

Using StorPool as a storage backend requires additional configuration to ensure
proper integration. These adjustments include network settings and file system mounts.

Configure Cinder to use StorPool by implementing the following settings:

.. code-block:: yaml

    cinder_helm_values:
      storage: storpool
      pod:
        useHostNetwork:
          volume: true

    The ``enable_iscsi`` setting is required to allow the Nova instances to
    expose volumes by making the `/dev` devices available to the containers,
    not necessarily to use iSCSI as the storage protocol. In this case, the
    StorPool devices will be exposed as block devices to the containers.

¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨
Disable backups in Horizon
¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨

To prevent users from creating backups through the Horizon dashboard (if your storage backend doesn't have a supported backup driver for Cinder), use the following settings:

.. code-block:: yaml

    horizon_helm_values:

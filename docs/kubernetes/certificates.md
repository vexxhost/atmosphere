# Certificates

## Manual certificate renewal

To renew certificates manually, run the following commands on all the
control-plane nodes.

- Renew your all certificates.

```sh
kubeadm certs renew all
```

- Restart control plane pods.

This is required since dynamic certificate reload is currently not supported
for all components and certificates. Static Pods are managed by the local
kubelet and not by the API Server, thus kubectl cannot be used to delete and
restart them.

```sh
ps auxf | egrep '(kube-(apiserver|controller-manager|scheduler)|etcd)' | awk '{ print $2 }' | xargs kill
```

# Atmosphere

Atmosphere is an advanced OpenStack distribution built by [VEXXHOST](https://vexxhost.com)
powered by Kuberentes, which allows you to easily deliver virtual machines,
Kubernetes and bare-metal on your on-premise hardware.

The difference between Atmosphere and other deployment tools is that it is
fully open source with batteries included.  It ships with settings that are
curated by years of experience from our team alongside comprehensive day-2
operations such as monitoring, centralized logging and simplified upgrades
that only require upgrading your Atmosphere version.

If you're looking to get started quickly, you can review our
[Quick Start](deploy/quick-start.md) guide.

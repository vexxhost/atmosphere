(see https://github.com/openstack-exporter/openstack-exporter/blob/a9937703684bb7fc5eadbf805354b1903af5cce9/exporters/loadbalancer.go#L17-L21)\n\n\nAs this alert call `OctaviaLoadBalancerNotActive`\nwe should collect all cases from gauge (includes those online lbs)\nSo in thise case we should do \n``count (openstack_loadbalancer_loadbalancer_status{provisioning_status!\u003d\"ACTIVE\"}) \u003e 0``\nor at least ``openstack_loadbalancer_loadbalancer_status{provisioning_status!\u003d\"ACTIVE\"} \u003e\u003d 0``\n\nnot sure the performance between count and count by, but I guess I\u0027m okay for either cases\n\nI think it will be friendly to describe the bug with some of above information in release note :)",

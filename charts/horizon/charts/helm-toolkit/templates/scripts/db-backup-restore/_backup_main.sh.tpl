#!/bin/bash

# This file contains a database backup framework which database scripts
# can use to perform a backup. The idea here is that the database-specific
# functions will be implemented by the various databases using this script
# (like mariadb, postgresql or etcd for example). The database-specific
# script will need to first "source" this file like this:
#   source /tmp/backup_main.sh
#
# Then the script should call the main backup function (backup_databases):
#   backup_databases [scope]
#       [scope] is an optional parameter, defaulted to "all". If only one specific
#               database is required to be backed up then this parameter will
#               contain the name of the database; otherwise all are backed up.
#
#       The framework will require the following variables to be exported:
#
#         export DB_NAMESPACE          Namespace where the database(s) reside
#         export DB_NAME               Name of the database system
#         export LOCAL_DAYS_TO_KEEP    Number of days to keep the local backups
#         export REMOTE_DAYS_TO_KEEP   Number of days to keep the remote backups
#         export ARCHIVE_DIR           Local location where the backup tarballs should
#                                      be stored. (full directory path)
#         export BACK_UP_MODE          Determines the mode of backup taken.
#         export REMOTE_BACKUP_ENABLED "true" if remote backup enabled; false
#                                      otherwise
#         export CONTAINER_NAME        Name of the container on the RGW to store
#                                      the backup tarball.
#         export STORAGE_POLICY        Name of the storage policy defined on the
#                                      RGW which is intended to store backups.
#         RGW access variables:
#           export OS_REGION_NAME          Name of the region the RGW resides in
#           export OS_AUTH_URL             Keystone URL associated with the RGW
#           export OS_PROJECT_NAME         Name of the project associated with the
#                                          keystone user
#           export OS_USERNAME             Name of the keystone user
#           export OS_PASSWORD             Password of the keystone user
#           export OS_USER_DOMAIN_NAME     Keystone domain the project belongs to
#           export OS_PROJECT_DOMAIN_NAME  Keystone domain the user belongs to
#           export OS_IDENTITY_API_VERSION Keystone API version to use
#
#           export REMOTE_BACKUP_RETRIES   Number of retries to send backup to remote
#                                          in case of any temporary failures.
#           export MIN_DELAY_SEND_REMOTE   Minimum seconds to delay before sending backup
#                                          to remote to stagger backups being sent to RGW
#           export MAX_DELAY_SEND_REMOTE   Maximum seconds to delay before sending backup
#                                          to remote to stagger backups being sent to RGW.
#                                          A random number between min and max delay is generated
#                                          to set the delay.
#
# The database-specific functions that need to be implemented are:
#   dump_databases_to_directory <directory> <err_logfile> [scope]
#       where:
#         <directory>   is the full directory path to dump the database files
#                       into. This is a temporary directory for this backup only.
#         <err_logfile> is the full directory path where error logs are to be
#                       written by the application.
#         [scope]       set to "all" if all databases are to be backed up; or
#                       set to the name of a specific database to be backed up.
#                       This optional parameter is defaulted to "all".
#       returns: 0 if no errors; 1 if any errors occurred
#
#       This function is expected to dump the database file(s) to the specified
#       directory path. If this function completes successfully (returns 0), the
#       framework will automatically tar/zip the files in that directory and
#       name the tarball appropriately according to the proper conventions.
#
# The functions in this file will take care of:
#   1) Calling "dump_databases_to_directory" and then compressing the files,
#      naming the tarball properly, and then storing it locally at the specified
#      local directory.
#   2) Sending the tarball built to the remote gateway, to be stored in the
#      container configured to store database backups.
#   3) Removing local backup tarballs which are older than the number of days
#      specified by the "LOCAL_DAYS_TO_KEEP" variable.
#   4) Removing remote backup tarballs (from the remote gateway) which are older
#      than the number of days specified by the "REMOTE_DAYS_TO_KEEP" variable.
#

# Note: not using set -e in this script because more elaborate error handling
# is needed.

# NOTE(mnaser): Since runs are so fast, the Prometheus Operator resoruces are
#               created before the MutatingWebhookConfiguration is ready, so
#               the resources end up being changed on the second apply.
#
#               The workaround for now is to wait for the operator to go up
#               which means the MutatingWebhookConfiguration is also ready.
